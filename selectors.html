        <h1>Variable declaration</h1>
        <p class="asd">Variables are containers for storing data values, a memory location for a data type. Variables are created using a declaration or keyword that varies across languages. Variable names are usually alphanumeric, that is, they contain a-z and 0-9. They can also include special characters like underscore or the dollar sign. Variables can hold values of any data type supported by the programming language. This value may change during program execution.
        </p>
        </p>For example, let's say you come to my website www.coderscampus.com and the first thing I want to do, is ask you what your name is (so that I can greet you in a nice way the next time you visit my website).  I would put a little text box on the screen that asks you what your name is… that text box would represent a variable!  Let's say I called that text box ‘yourName', that would be the symbolic name (or “word”) for your variable (as described from our wiki definition above)
        <p>


        <h1>Basic syntax</h1>
        <p class="asd">Every programming language has its syntax, and you must learn the fundamental syntax of the language you are learning. Syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure of a language. It is almost impossible to read or understand a programming language without its syntax.
        </p>

        <h1>Flow control structures</h1>
        <p class="asd">Flow Control Structures are the fundamental components of computer programs. They are commands that allow a program to “decide” to take one direction or another. There are three basic types of control structures: sequential, selection, and iteration.
        </p>
        <p>o now, when you type your name into the text box, that information would be stored in a variable called ‘yourName'.  I would then be able to come back and say “What value does the variable ‘yourName' contain?”, and the program would tell me whatever it was your typed into that text box. This concept is extremely powerful in coding and is used constantly.  It is what makes Facebook and Twitter work, it's what makes paying your bills via your online bank work, it's what allows you to place a bid on eBay.  Variables make the programming world go 'round.       
        </p>

        <h1>What is a variable?</h1>
        <p class="asd">Variables are the backbone of any program, and thus the backbone of any computer programming language. I like to start off by defining what we're about to learn, so, Wikipedia defines a variable as follows: In computer programming, a variable is a storage location and an associated symbolic name which contains some known or unknown quantity or information, a value.Okay, well, that's kind of cryptic.  To me, a variable is simply a way to store some sort of information for later use, and we can retrieve this information by referring to a “word” that will describe this information.
