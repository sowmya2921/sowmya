            <h1>GANDHI JAYANTI</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Gandhi Jayanti celebrated on 2nd October is also an important day. Though it is a national holiday, the celebration is not on the same scale as Republic Day and Independence Day. Yet it has caught the imagination of the entire nation as this day carries a strong message of peace and harmony that resonates with every Indian. Mahatma Gandhi, who led by example, Gandhi's values and belief in Satyagraha (truth) and Ahimsa (non-violence) have stood the test of time. On this day, by attending lectures about Gandhi and listening to devotional songs, every Indian strengthens his belief in the actuality of an equal society and a peaceful and uncorrupted world. Mahatma Gandhi's vision was exemplary, vast in scope and deeply powerful in impact for human societies. As such, Gandhi's relevance makes this day very special for everyone. To commemorate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday, the President, Prime Minister and other dignitaries pay homage to Gandhi at Raj Ghat, New Delhi where he was cremated. Also, events, such as paintings, creative writing, and essay competitions are organized to create a better understanding about the life of Gandhi. The song 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram', which was close to his heart has a spiritual quality is sung at various places. Perhaps the best way to celebrate this day is to make a resolution to imbibe Gandhian values in our lives and come good on it. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nationwide 'Clean India Drive' on Gandhi Jayant.
